# Lung Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide.  
Early detection plays a critical role in improving survival rates.  
In this project, we apply various **supervised machine learning algorithms** to detect lung cancer at an early stage.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To explore the effectiveness of ML algorithms in detecting early-stage lung tumors.
- To compare multiple supervised learning models.
- To identify the best-performing model for lung cancer detection.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**
- **ANN (Artificial Neural Network)**
- **MLR (Multiple Linear Regression)**
- **RF (Random Forest)**

## 📊 Results
- Among all models, **Random Forest** achieved the highest accuracy of **99.99%**,  
  making it the most reliable approach for early-stage lung cancer detection.

Here’s a minimal requirements.txt for your embeddings + ML project:

sentence-transformers==3.0.1
scikit-learn==1.5.1
numpy==1.26.4
pandas==2.2.2
torch>=2.2.0
transformers>=4.40.0

🔹 Add it to your repo

Run these commands in your project folder:

echo sentence-transformers==3.0.1 > requirements.txt
echo scikit-learn==1.5.1 >> requirements.txt
echo numpy==1.26.4 >> requirements.txt
echo pandas==2.2.2 >> requirements.txt
echo torch>=2.2.0 >> requirements.txt
echo transformers>=4.40.0 >> requirements.txt

git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Added clean requirements.txt"
git push


✅ Now anyone can clone your repo and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt


to set up the environment.
